## Approach & Efficiency
The program informs how to handle user input. The approach to solve this problem is to read user input, update an 
in-memory data structure to track user inputs, and display the appropriate response accordingly. String manipulation 
be used to handle user inputs. String interpolation will be used to handle menu items.
